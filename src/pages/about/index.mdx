# Ultra Heavy Beat

Hello, and welcome to my music/gear site - an homage to G.A.S!

This site mainly catalogues gear that I own/have owned, useful info to me that I'll forget if I don't write it down,
and fun sounds that I have maybe made.

## Posts

The main landing of this site is a blog, probably around small gear demos, or just fun jam sessions.

## Gear Pages

I've tried to structure it so that each piece of gear has its own page with a brief overview. In addition to the main blog landing page,
each gear page also has a feed of related posts, so you can easily find info/demos of the gear you might be interested in!

## Glossary

In an effort to remember what things mean, or at least know where to look, I've added an (ever growing) glossary page
with some terms and definitions that may be handy.
